# Revamped WhatsTypescript

As someone whose current level of understanding of Typescript and React has just increased by a TON,
I want to put these skills to the test by re-creating this project, entirely in React and Typescript.

Goals:
- Have React be the heart and soul of this project
- Use Typescript and practice identifying types and letting Typescript enforce them for me
- Maybe even write some tests in the future!!!
